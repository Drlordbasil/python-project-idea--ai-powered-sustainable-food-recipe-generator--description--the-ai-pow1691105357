## Features

1. **Web Scraping**: The program uses BeautifulSoup library to scrape recipe websites and extract relevant information, such as ingredients, cooking instructions, and nutritional values.
2. **Sustainable Ingredient Selection**: The program applies predefined sustainability criteria to filter the extracted ingredients. It prioritizes seasonal and locally sourced ingredients that have a lower carbon footprint and avoids ingredients that are environmentally problematic (e.g., overfished species).
3. **Recipe Generation**: Using the filtered ingredients, the program generates new recipes by combining ingredients from different sources. It ensures the recipes are diverse, balanced, and tailored to specific dietary preferences or restrictions.
4. **Nutritional Analysis**: The program utilizes data processing libraries like pandas to analyze the nutritional values of the generated recipes. It provides detailed information on calories, macronutrients, and vitamins, encouraging users to maintain a healthy and balanced diet.
5. **Shopping List Generation**: The program creates a shopping list for each generated recipe, listing the required ingredients. It also suggests alternative ingredients based on availability, allowing users to make sustainable choices even when certain ingredients are not accessible.
6. **User Feedback and Ratings**: The program can incorporate user feedback and ratings to learn users' preferences over time. It adapts its recipe generation algorithms based on user interactions, ensuring a personalized and enjoyable cooking experience.
7. **Integration with Meal Planning Apps**: The program can integrate with popular meal planning apps and platforms, making it easier for users to incorporate sustainable recipes into their weekly meal plans. This integration allows users to view, save, and schedule generated recipes directly through their preferred meal planning app.

## Business Plan

The AI-Powered Sustainable Food Recipe Generator has the potential to generate profit through the following revenue streams:

1. **Partnerships with Sustainable Food Brands**: The program can establish partnerships with sustainable food brands that align with the program's mission. This could include organic food producers, sustainable seafood providers, or environmentally friendly food packaging companies. The program can promote these brands' products within the generated recipes and provide referral links or affiliate commissions.

2. **Grocery Delivery Services**: The program can collaborate with grocery delivery services to offer seamless purchasing options for the ingredients required in the generated recipes. This partnership can involve integrating the program with the delivery service's platform, allowing users to add recipe ingredients to their shopping carts directly.

3. **Meal Kit Providers**: The program can work with meal kit providers to create exclusive sustainable recipe kits. These kits can include all the ingredients needed for the generated recipes and be delivered directly to the users' homes. Revenue can be generated through revenue-sharing agreements with the meal kit providers.

4. **Premium Subscription Plans**: The program can offer premium subscription plans that provide users with enhanced features and exclusive content. These plans could include personalized recommendations, access to a broader recipe database, or advanced nutritional analysis.
